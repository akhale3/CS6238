JDK Version: Java SE 1.7

Compilation: javac Login.java

Execution:  java Login

Libraries:
1. Standard libraries
2. Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)  Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 7 

Functionality:
1. On execution, the program queries the user for account creation or login.
2. According to the choice, it requests the user to enter username, password and security questions.
3. On creation of the account, the user is prompted for username, password and securtiy questions. Using the formula class, a large prime number is generated from which an encryption password is generated. A polynomial and an instruction table are generated depending on the answers. The instruction table contains the alpha and beta values which are based on the password. A history file is created into which all the feature vectors i.e., security question and answers are stored. This file is encrypted using the generated hardened password.
4. If the user choose to login with his credentials, the user enters the username and password and answers security questions. Depending on his answers, alpha or beta values from the instruction table are chosen. Using the instruction table, the XY coordinates of the polynomial are generated. Using these values the encryption password is generated and the history file is decrypted. The decrypted history file is then populated with or overwritten with the new feature vector values and is encrypted using a new encryption password generated and a new polynomial and instruction table is generated.
